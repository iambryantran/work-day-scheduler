# Work Day Scheduler

## This Repository

This repository is where I have created a single day task manager as an assignment for a coding bootcamp. The objective of this code is to build a single day task manager that breaks down the standard 9-5 work day into hour blocks. Each block will change color based on the time of day. Hours passed will be grey, the current hour is red, and future hours are green. Each hour has a text area for a user to input tasks and a save button to save to local storage.
